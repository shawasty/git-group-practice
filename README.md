Fiji has been inhabited for hundreds of years by the native Fijian people and then later settlers of European nations on their expeditions to explore the world.

Today Fiji is a fusion of old and new cultures and is a popular tourist destination.

Although most people think that Fiji is just one island, it is actually a group of 332 islands that sit between Hawaii and New Zealand.

There are four main islands where most of the population lives: Viti Levu, Vana Levu, Ono-i-Lau, and Kadavu Island.

Viti Levu is the biggest island with an area of 4,011 square miles (10388.44 square kilometers) and is home to the capital city, Suva.

The second largest is Vana Levu, which is 2,157 square miles (5,587.1 square kilometers). It’s situated 39.77 miles (64 km) north of Viti Levu.

Ono-i-Lau is the name of a collection of islands that are enclosed by the reef. This collection of islands is known as Lau Islands and is considered the third largest island area of Fiji. It has a total area of 173.7 square miles (450 square kilometers).

The fourth-largest island of Fiji is Kadavu Island, with a total area of 158.68 square miles (411 square kilometers).
